Q : My projectiles didnt dye itself ?
- This mod has 2 modes to render projectiles. Graphically Correct and Legacy Fast
- Go to mod config and you can see there is a list and a button to change which mode it should use
- By default projectiles use Legacy Fast to Fastly render but sometimes it doesnt work correctly. 
- So u can use Graphically Correct if you want

Q : How to duplicate accesories ?
- Craft Accesory duplicator and craft your duplicate in the recipe ui

Q : Why is there a suspiciously upside down T shaped Item ?
- you dont need to know that

Q : Isnt this Dyeable Anything ?
